# Windwos Fundamentals

Get hands-on access to Windows and it's security controls. These basics will help you in identifying, exploiting and defending Windows.

Windows is the most popular operating system, used by both individuals and corporate environments all around the world. This module will get you comfortable using some of the key Windows features (in a safe environment), including user account permissions, resource management and monitoring, registry access and security controls.

## part 1

In part 1 of the Windows Fundamentals module, we'll start our journey learning about the Windows desktop, the NTFS file system, UAC, the Control Panel, and more..

### The Desktop (GUI)

The Windows Desktop, aka the graphical user interface or GUI in short, is the screen that welcomes you once you log into a Windows 10 machine.

### The File System

The file system used in modern versions of  Windows  is the **New Technology File System** or simply **[NTFS](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/storage/file-server/ntfs-overview)** .

Before NTFS, there was  **FAT16/FAT32** (File Allocation Table) and **HPFS** (High Performance File System). 

You still see FAT partitions in use today. For example, you typically see FAT partitions in USB devices, MicroSD cards, etc.  but traditionally not on personal Windows computers/laptops or Windows servers.

NTFS is known as a journaling file system. In case of a failure, the file system can automatically repair the folders/files on disk using information stored in a log file. This function is not possible with FAT.   

NTFS addresses many of the limitations of the previous file systems; such as: 

- Supports files larger than 4GB
- Set specific permissions on folders and files
- Folder and file compression
- Encryption ( [Encryption File System](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fileio/file-encryption) or EFS )

If you're running Windows, what is the file system your Windows installation is using? You can check the Properties (right-click) of the drive your operating system is installed on, typically the C drive (C:\).

![/win-file-system](assets/win-file-system.gif)

You can read Microsoft's official documentation on FAT, HPFS, and NTFS [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-client/backup-and-storage/fat-hpfs-and-ntfs-file-systems) . 

Let's speak briefly on some features that are specific to NTFS. 

On NTFS volumes, you can set permissions that grant or deny access to files and folders.

The permissions are:

- Full control
- Modify
- Read & Execute
- List folder contents
- Read
- Write

The below image lists the meaning of each permission on how it applies to a file and a folder. (credit  [Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-2000-server/bb727008(v=technet.10)?redirectedfrom=MSDN) )

| Permission | Meaning for Folders | Meaning for Files |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Read | Permits viewing and listing of files and subfolders | Permits viewing or accessing of the file's contents |
| Write | Permits adding of files and subfolders | Permits writing to a file |
| Read & Execute | Permits viewing and listing of files and subfolders as well as executing of files; inherited by files and folders | Permits viewing and accessing of the file's contents as well as executing of the file |
| List Folder Contents | Permits viewing and listing of files and subfolders as well as executing of files; inherited by folders only | N/A |
| Modify | Permits reading and writing of files and subfolders; allows deletion of the folder | Permits reading and writing of the file; allows deletion of the file |
| Full Control | Permits reading, writing, changing, and deleting of files and subfolders | Permits reading, writing, changing and deleting of the file | 

How can you view the permissions for a file or folder?

- Right-click the file or folder you want to check for permissions.
- From the context menu, select **Properties** .
- Within Properties, click on the **Security** tab.
- In the **Group or user names** list, select the user, computer, or group whose permissions you want to view.

In the below image, you can see the permissions for the **Users** group for the Windows folder. 

![windows-folder-permissions](assets/windows-folder-permissions.png)

Refer to the Microsoft documentation to get a better understanding of the NTFS permissions for  Special Permissions .

Another feature of NTFS is **Alternate Data Streams ( ADS )**.

**Alternate Data Streams**  (ADS) is a file attribute specific to Windows  **NTFS**  (New Technology File System).

Every file has at least one data stream ( **$DATA** ), and ADS allows files to contain more than one stream of data. Natively [Window Explorer](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/file-explorer-in-windows-ef370130-1cca-9dc5-e0df-2f7416fe1cb1) doesn't display ADS to the user. There are 3rd party executables that can be used to view this data, but [Powershell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/overview?view=powershell-7.5&viewFallbackFrom=powershell-7.1) gives you the ability to view ADS for files.

From a security perspective, malware writers have used ADS to hide data.

Not all its uses are malicious. For example, when you download a file from the Internet, there are identifiers written to ADS to identify that the file was downloaded from the Internet.

To learn more about ADS, refer to the following link from MalwareBytes [here](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/101/2015/07/introduction-to-alternate-data-streams) . 

Bonus : If you wish to interact hands-on with ADS, I suggest exploring Day 21 of  Advent of Cyber 2 .

### The Windows\System32 Folders

The Windows folder ( **C:\Windows** ) is traditionally known as the folder which contains the Windows operating system. 

The folder doesn't have to reside in the C drive necessarily. It can reside in any other drive and technically can reside in a different folder.

This is where environment variables, more specifically system environment variables, come into play.  Even though not discussed yet, the system  environment variable for the Windows directory is **%windir%**.

Per Microsoft , " Environment variables store information about the operating system environment. This information includes details such as the operating system path, the number of processors used by the operating system, and the location of temporary folders ".

There are many folders within the 'Windows' folder. See below.

![windows-folder](assets/windows-folder.png)

One of the many folders is **System32** . 

![windows-system32](assets/windows-system32.png)

The System32 folder holds the important files that are critical for the operating system.

You should proceed with extreme caution when interacting with this folder. Accidentally deleting any files or folders within System32 can render the Windows OS inoperational. Read more about this action [here](https://www.howtogeek.com/346997/what-is-the-system32-directory-and-why-you-shouldnt-delete-it) . 

**Operating System (OS)** is a layer between the hardware and the applications. From the application's perspective, the OS provides an interface to access the different hardware components, such as CPU, RAM, and disk storage. Examples of OS are Android, FreeBSD, Linux, macOS, and Windows.

**Note:** Many of the tools that will be covered in the Windows Fundamentals series reside within the System32 folder. 

### User Accounts, Profiles, and Permissions

User accounts can be one of two types on a typical local Windows system: **Administrator** & **Standard User**. 

The user account type will determine what actions the user can perform on that specific Windows system. 

- An Administrator can make changes to the system: add users, delete users, modify groups, modify settings on the system, etc. 
- A Standard User can only make changes to folders/files attributed to the user & can't perform system-level changes, such as install programs.

one way to access this information, and then some, is using Local User and Group Management. 

Right-click on the Start Menu and click Run. Type **lusrmgr.msc**.

Each group has permissions set to it, and users are assigned/added to groups by the Administrator. When a user is assigned to a group, the user inherits the permissions of that group. A user can be assigned to multiple groups.

**Note:** If you click on **Add someone else to this PC** from **Other users**, it will open **Local Users and Management.** 


### User Account Control

startup: win + R enter UserAccountControlSettings

The UAC settings can be changed or even turned off entirely (not recommended).

You can move the slider to see how the setting will change the UAC settings and Microsoft's stance on the setting.

The large majority of home users are logged into their Windows systems as local administrators. Remember any user with administrator as the account type can make changes to the system.

A user doesn't need to run with high (elevated) privileges on the system to run tasks that don't require such privileges, such as surfing the Internet, working on a Word document, etc. This elevated privilege increases the risk of system compromise because it makes it easier for malware to infect the system. Consequently, since the user account can make changes to the system, the malware would run in the context of the logged-in user.

To protect the local user with such privileges, Microsoft introduced **User Account Control (UAC)**. This concept was first introduced with the short-lived Windows Vista  and continued with versions of Windows that followed.

**User Account Control (UAC)** helps prevent malware from damaging a PC and helps organizations deploy a better-managed desktop. With UAC, apps and tasks always run in the security context of a non-administrator account, unless an administrator specifically authorizes administrator-level access to the system. UAC can block the automatic installation of unauthorized apps and prevent inadvertent changes to system settings.

**Note:** UAC (by default) doesn't apply for the built-in local administrator account. 

How does UAC work? When a user with an account type of administrator logs into a system, the current session doesn't run with elevated permissions. When an operation requiring higher-level privileges needs to execute, the user will be prompted to confirm if they permit the operation to run. 

### Settings and the Control Panel

On a Windows system, the primary locations to make changes are the Settings menu and the Control Panel.

win + R enter control

### Task Manager

The Task Manager provides information about the applications and processes currently running on the system. Other information is also available, such as how much CPU and RAM are being utilized, which falls under Performance. 

## part 2

In part 2 of the Windows Fundamentals module, discover more about System Configuration, UAC Settings, Resource Monitoring, the Windows Registry and more..

### System Configuration

The **System Configuration** utility (**MSConfig**) is for advanced troubleshooting, and its main purpose is to help diagnose startup issues. 

Reference the following document [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-client/performance/system-configuration-utility-troubleshoot-configuration-errors) for more information on the System Configuration utility. 

Start Menu: win + R enter msconfig

**Note:** You need local administrator rights to open this utility. 

### Change UAC Settings

We're continuing with Tools that are available through the **System Configuration** panel.

### Computer Management

**startup:** win + R enter compmgmt.msc

The Computer Management (**compmgmt**) utility has three primary sections: **System Tools, Storage**, and **Services and Applications**.

### System Information

**startup:** win + r enter msinfo32

What is the **System Information (msinfo32)** tool?

Per Microsoft, "Windows includes a tool called Microsoft System Information (Msinfo32.exe).  This tool gathers information about your computer and displays a comprehensive view of your hardware, system components, and software environment, which you can use to diagnose computer issues."

The  information in **System Summary** is divided into three sections:

- Hardware Resources
- Components
- Software Environment

System Summary will display general technical specifications for the computer, such as processor brand and model.

### Resource Monitor

**startup:** win + r enter resmon

What is Resource **Monitor (resmon)**?

> Per Microsoft, "Resource Monitor displays per-process and aggregate CPU, memory, disk, and network usage information, in addition to providing details about which processes are using individual file handles and modules. Advanced filtering allows users to isolate the data related to one or more processes (either applications or services), start, stop, pause, and resume services, and close unresponsive applications from the user interface. It also includes a process analysis feature that can help identify deadlocked processes and file locking conflicts so that the user can attempt to resolve the conflict instead of closing an application and potentially losing data."

In the Overview tab, Resmon has four sections:

- CPU
- Disk
- Network
- Memory

 ### Registry Editor

 🚀**startup:** win + r enter regedt32.exe

 The **Windows Registry** (per Microsoft) is a central hierarchical database used to store information necessary to configure the system for one or more users, applications, and hardware devices. 

 The registry contains information that Windows continually references during operation, such as:

- Profiles for each user
- Applications installed on the computer and the types of documents that each can create
- Property sheet settings for folders and application icons
- What hardware exists on the system
- The ports that are being used.

**Warning:** The registry is for advanced computer users. Making changes to the registry can affect normal computer operations. 

There are various ways to view/edit the registry. One way is to use the **Registry Editor (regedit)**.

Refer to the following Microsoft documentation [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/performance/windows-registry-advanced-users) to learn more about the Windows Registry. 

## part 3

In part 3 of the Windows Fundamentals module, learn about the built-in Microsoft tools that help keep the device secure, such as Windows Updates, Windows Security, BitLocker, and more...

### Windows Update

Updates are typically released on the 2nd Tuesday of each month. This day is called Patch Tuesday. That doesn't necessarily mean that a critical update/patch has to wait for the next Patch Tuesday to be released. If the update is urgent, then Microsoft will push the update via the Windows Update service to the Windows devices.

Refer to the following link to see the Microsoft Security Update Guide [here](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide).  

Tip: Another way to access Windows Update is from the Run dialog box, or CMD, by running the command **control /name Microsoft.WindowsUpdate**.


### Windows Security

> Per Microsoft, "Windows Security is your home to manage the tools that protect your device and your data".


### Firewall & network protection

**What is a firewall?**

A security tool, hardware or software that is used to filter network traffic by stopping unauthorized incoming and outgoing traffic.

> Per Microsoft, "Traffic flows into and out of devices via what we call ports. A firewall is what controls what is - and more importantly isn't - allowed to pass through those ports. You can think of it like a security guard standing at the door, checking the ID of everything that tries to enter or exit".

**Note: Each network may have different status icons for you.**

What is the difference between the 3 (Domain, Private, and Public)?

> Per Microsoft, "Windows Firewall offers three firewall profiles: domain, private and public".

- **Domain** - The domain profile applies to networks where the host system can authenticate to a domain controller. 
- **Private** - The private profile is a user-assigned profile and is used to designate private or home networks.
- **Public** - The default profile is the public profile, used to designate public networks such as Wi-Fi hotspots at coffee shops, airports, and other locations.

Configuring the Windows Defender Firewall is for advanced Windows users. Refer to the following Microsoft documentation on best practices [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/operating-system-security/network-security/windows-firewall/configure). 

Tip: Command to open the Windows Defender Firewall is **WF.msc**. 

### App & browser control

> Per Microsoft, "Microsoft Defender SmartScreen protects against phishing or malware websites and applications, and the downloading of potentially malicious files".

Refer to the official Microsoft document for more information on Microsoft Defender SmartScreen [here](https://feedback.smartscreen.microsoft.com/smartscreenfaq.aspx). 

**Check apps and files**

- Windows Defender SmartScreen helps protect your device by checking for unrecognized apps and files from the web. 

**Exploit protection**

- Exploit protection is built into Windows 10 (and, in our case, Windows Server 2019) to help protect your device against attacks. 

### Device security

Even though you'll probably never change any of these settings, for completion's sake, it will be covered briefly.

**Core isolation**

- **Memory Integrity** - Prevents attacks from inserting malicious code into high-security processes.

**Security processor**

Your security processor, called the trusted platform module (TPM), is providing additional encryption for your device.

What is the **Trusted Platform Module (TPM)**?

> Per Microsoft, "Trusted Platform Module (TPM) technology is designed to provide hardware-based, security-related functions. A TPM chip is a secure crypto-processor that is designed to carry out cryptographic operations. The chip includes multiple physical security mechanisms to make it tamper-resistant, and malicious software is unable to tamper with the security functions of the TPM".

### BitLocker

What is **BitLocker?**

> Per Microsoft, "BitLocker Drive Encryption is a data protection feature that integrates with the operating system and addresses the threats of data theft or exposure from lost, stolen, or inappropriately decommissioned computers".

On devices with TPM installed, BitLocker offers the best protection.

Per Microsoft, *"BitLocker provides the most protection when used with a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) version 1.2 or later. The TPM is a hardware component installed in many newer computers by the computer manufacturers. It works with BitLocker to help protect user data and to ensure that a computer has not been tampered with while the system was offline".*

Refer to the official Microsoft documentation to learn more about BitLocker [phere](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/operating-system-security/data-protection/bitlocker/). 

### Volume Shadow Copy Service

Per [Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/storage/file-server/volume-shadow-copy-service), **the Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS)** coordinates the required actions to create a consistent shadow copy (also known as a snapshot or a point-in-time copy) of the data that is to be backed up. 

Volume Shadow Copies are stored on the System Volume Information folder on each drive that has protection enabled.

If VSS is enabled (**System Protection** turned on), you can perform the following tasks from within **advanced system settings**. 

- Create a restore point
- Perform system restore
- Configure restore settings
- Delete restore points

From a security perspective, malware writers know of this Windows feature and write code in their malware to look for these files and delete them. Doing so makes it impossible to recover from a ransomware attack unless you have an offline/off-site backup

<span style="font-size: 23px;">**end**</span>

Note: Attackers use built-in Windows tools and utilities in an attempt to go undetected within the victim environment.  This tactic is known as Living Off The Land. Refer to the following resource [here](https://lolbas-project.github.io/) to learn more about this.
