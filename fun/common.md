## ACAO

The **Access-Control-Allow-Origin** (ACAO) header is included in the response from one website to a request originating from another website, and identifies the permitted origin of the request. A web browser compares the Access-Control-Allow-Origin with the requesting website's origin and permits access to the response if they match.

## AD

**Active Directory** is a directory service developed by Microsoft for Windows domain networks. It stores information about network objects such as computers, users, and groups. It provides authentication and authorisation services, and allows administrators to manage network resources centrally.

## ACL

ACL（Access Control List，访问控制列表）是在代理服务器中定义哪些请求路径是允许访问的，哪些是被禁止的。

🔍 在 HTTP/2 请求走私攻击的场景中，有几个关键点与 ACL 直接相关：

- 当前端代理解析 HTTP/2 请求时，它只看到请求的第一部分，例如 `/hello`，这是 ACL 允许的路径。
- 但该请求实际上被分成两个 HTTP/1.1 请求，第二个请求指向的是 `/admin`，这是受限制的路径——ACL 不允许访问。
- 因此，通过“请求走私”技巧，攻击者能够利用一个合法路径（如 `/hello`）偷偷将一个非法路径（如 `/admin`）的请求发送到后端服务器。
- 从代理的角度来看，请求似乎合法，没有违反 ACL，但实际后端接收到了一个违规请求。

✨ 简而言之：攻击者利用代理只检查请求的第一部分这一特点，绕过了 ACL 的限制，将非法请求隐藏在合法请求之中。

## ALPN

Application Layer Protocol Negotiation（ALPN）是一种 **TLS 扩展机制**，用于在建立安全连接时协商使用哪种应用层协议——比如 HTTP/1.1 或 HTTP/2。

🔍 ALPN 的作用是什么？

- 它允许客户端和服务器在 **TLS 握手阶段**就确定使用的协议，**无需额外的网络往返**。
- 这对于支持多个协议的服务（例如同时支持 HTTP/1.1 和 HTTP/2 的网站）非常重要。
- ALPN 通过在 TLS 的 `ClientHello` 消息中附加一个协议列表，服务器从中选择一个并在 `ServerHello` 中返回。

📦 应用场景举例

- 浏览器访问支持 HTTP/2 的网站时，会通过 ALPN 告诉服务器它支持 `h2` 和 `http/1.1`。
- 服务器选择 `h2`，于是双方就用 HTTP/2 通信了——**整个过程只需一次 TLS 握手**。

🧠 与 HTTP 请求走私的关系

在你查看的页面中，ALPN 被提及是因为它在 **HTTP/2 请求走私攻击**中扮演了关键角色：

- 某些代理服务器支持 HTTP/2，但后端仍使用 HTTP/1.1。
- ALPN 协商后，前端使用 HTTP/2，后端却被降级为 HTTP/1.1。
- 攻击者可以构造特殊的 HTTP/2 请求，使代理在转换为 HTTP/1.1 时发生 **请求边界错位**，从而实现走私攻击。

这种“协议降级”场景正是 ALPN 协商失败或被滥用的结果。

## CIDR

CIDR（Classless Inter-Domain Routing，无类域间路由）是一种 **IP地址分配和路由优化技术**，用于提高网络地址空间的利用率和路由效率。

🌐 CIDR 的核心概念
- **打破传统分类地址**：CIDR 不再使用 A、B、C 类地址，而是采用灵活的地址块划分方式。
- **使用前缀长度表示网络范围**：例如 `192.168.0.0/24` 表示前 24 位是网络地址，剩下的是主机地址。
- **支持可变长度子网掩码（VLSM）**：可以根据实际需求划分大小不同的子网。

📦 CIDR 表示法示例
| CIDR 表示 | 网络地址范围 | 可用主机数 |
|-----------|----------------|-------------|
| `192.168.1.0/24` | `192.168.1.0` 到 `192.168.1.255` | 254 |
| `10.0.0.0/8`     | `10.0.0.0` 到 `10.255.255.255`   | 16,777,214 |

> 注意：可用主机数通常是总数减去网络地址和广播地址。

🚀 CIDR 的优势
- **节省 IP 地址**：避免地址浪费，尤其在 IPv4 中非常重要。
- **简化路由表**：多个地址块可以聚合成一个更大的块，减少路由器负担。
- **灵活划分网络**：适用于不同规模的组织和网络结构。

It helps to mitigate XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) and other attacks by restricting the resources (such as scripts, images, and styles) that a web page can load. CSP consists of a series of instructions sent from a website to a browser, which instructs the browser on what content is allowed to be loaded, thereby minimizing the risk of security threats. The CSP is implemented via HTTP response headers, enhancing the security of web pages by declaring which dynamic resources are permitted to load.
